# pr-jira

> A GitHub App that checks the consistency between pull requests and JIRA issues

## Usage

For each pull request matching a JIRA issue (see [`issueKeyRegex`](#developer-configuration)), the consistency is checked (GitHub milestone corresponds to [JIRA issue fix version](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/versions)).

When a JIRA related pull request is merged, this app warns the author if the JIRA issue is not updated (see [`postMergeStatus`](#developer-configuration)).

### GitHub Actions

To use this bot with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), the following workflow can be defined as `.github/workflows/jira.yml` in your repository.

```
name: JIRA consistency

on: 
  issues:
    types: ['milestoned', 'demilestoned']
  pull_request:
    types: ['opened', 'edited', 'synchronize', 'reopened', 'closed']
  schedule:
    - cron: '5 * * * *'

jobs:
  jira_pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: cchantep/probot-jira@ghaction-1.0.x
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PERSONAL_TOKEN_VALUE: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN_VALUE }}
          PERSONAL_TOKEN_USER: 'github user name'
          JIRA_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
          JIRA_DOMAIN: 'my.domain.tld' # only domain, without http[s]://
          JIRA_USER: 'my-jira-login@foo.bar'
          JIRA_PROJECT_NAME: 'PRJ'
```

*GitHub action limitations:* Has there is no specific process to uninstall an action, this app is not able to remove its JIRA hooks when no longer used in a GitHub workflow (have to remove manually the JIRA hook with a name of form `github-pr-jira*`).

### Global configuration
[**How to create secrets**](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) (required)

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is generated by github automatically, no need to create it anywhere.

The `JIRA_API_TOKEN` must be defined in the repository secrets (see [Atlassian Cloud Support](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html)) (see `JIRA_USER` thereafter).
This token must be allowed to read and write hooks using the JIRA REST API, and to read issue for the configured projects.

The `PERSONAL_TOKEN_VALUE` must be set with a [GitHub user token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) having access to the repository ([`repo` scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/#available-scopes); see `PERSONAL_TOKEN_USER` thereafter).

**JIRA integration:**

To complete the JIRA integration, the following environment variables are required.

- `JIRA_DOMAIN`: Your JIRA domain (e.g. foo.atlassian.net)
- `JIRA_USER`: User name that this application impersonates when accessing JIRA (with the following `JIRA_API_TOKEN` as password).
- `JIRA_PROJECT_NAME`: The JIRA project name (generally a 3 uppercase key).
- `PERSONAL_TOKEN_USER`: The name of the user for which the secret `PERSONAL_TOKEN_VALUE` is defined.

> When this is configured as [GitHub workflow](#github-actions), the previous settings can be defined as input (set in environment with `INPUT_` prefix).

If deployed as a shared instance, to define the JIRA settings per GitHub repository, add a uppercase prefix with owner and repository name: e.g. `MYUSER_MYREPO_JIRA_DOMAIN`.

### Developer configuration

On each repository for which the application is installed, a file named [`.github/pr-jira.json`](./src/resources/pr-jira.json) can be defined (defaults thereafter).

```json
{
  "issueKeyRegex": "^\\[([^\\[^\\]]+)\\].*$",
  "fixVersionRegex": "^(.+)$",
  "postMergeStatus": [ "Done" ]
}
```

- `issueKeyRegex`: Regular expression to check whether the title of pull request matches a JIRA issue. One capture group is expected, to extract the issue key from corresponding pull request.
- `fixVersionRegex`: Regular expression to capture (with the first group) the milestone from a JIRA fix version.
- `postMergeStatus`: One or more JIRA status names (as displayed in the JIRA UI), that are expected for an JIRA issue corresponding to a merged pull request.

This configuration is considered per each base branch.
